###Hello! What's your background, and what are you working on?
###你好，你的背景是什么样的，以及你的项目是？


I'm Eran Galperin, a software developer and tech entrepreneur. I've been developing web applications for over 14 years now. I started working in the industry while studying for physics degree back in 2004.

我是Eran Galperin，我是一个软件开发者和科技创业者。我已经有14年的软件开发经历了。早在2004年我就读物理学时就开始在这个行业工作。

During college I co-founded a web development shop that focused on SaaS development. After accumulating experience and some capital, one of my co-founders and I started Binpress, a marketplace for open-source code. During our time with Binpress, we went through the 500Startups accelerator program and raised an institutional seed round.
在大学期间，我共同创办了一家专注于SaaS开发的网络开发商店。在积累了经验和一些资本之后，我的一位创始人和我开始了Binpress，一个开源代码市场。在我们运营Binpress期间，我们通过了500Startups加速器计划并筹集了一次种子轮机构融资。


We ended up selling our company at the end of 2015, mainly to pay back investors (read a full post-mortem here). Following that, I started Martial Arts on Rails, which provides online management to gyms and martial arts schools. It's now generating almost $5k in monthly recurring revenue.

我们最终在2015年底出售公司，主要用于偿还投资者（请在此阅读完整的[事后检讨报告](http://techfounder.net/2016/02/11/binpress-postmortem/)）。 之后，我借助Rails进行了武术相关的创业，为体育馆和武术学校提供在线管理。 它现在每月产生5千美元的经常性收入。

###What motivated you to get started with Martial Arts on Rails?
###是什么促使你开始了借助Rails进行武术相关的创业呢？


I've been training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for close to a decade. After selling my previous company, I was looking for ideas for my next project and I knew that I wanted to combine my passion for Jiu-Jitsu with my SaaS expertise.
  
我已经在巴西柔术队接受了近十年的训练。在出售我以前的公司后，我一直在为我的下一个项目寻找创意，并且我知道我想将我对柔术的热情与我的SaaS专业知识相结合。


I started interviewing the people who manage the gyms I trained in, and identified a pain point with the software they use — it's generally bloated and outdated and feels like Windows 3.1 software. With my background in software development and user-experience design, I figured I could do much better and began working on an early prototype. To get more data points, I also tried asking on reddit — and overall the response was positive, though some people thought I was getting in over my head.
  
我开始采访管理我所在健身房的人员，并且发现他们的一个痛点：他们在使用的软件臃肿而过时，那感觉就像在现在还是使用Windows 3.1一样。


##"Start a business in a market you're deeply familiar with to increase your chances of success."
##"在您熟悉的市场开展业务，以增加成功的机会。"



I had a lot of experience building SaaS products, so I knew that I could get something up and running by myself in the timeframe of a couple of months. I had a designer friend come up with the basic concept and style, and took it from there to create all of the flows in the app. During development, I kept showing my work-in-progress to gym managers in the area to make sure I was on the right path.  
我在构建SaaS产品方面有很多经验，所以我知道我可以在几个月的时间内完成并运营一款产品。我有一位设计师朋友设计了基本概念和风格，并从那里开始创建应用程序中的所有流程的界面。在开发期间，我一直向该地区的健身房经理展示我的工作进展，以确保我没有走弯路。

During this time I wasn't working or generating other income, just living frugally off of savings. I didn't have much of a budget for advertising or marketing, so I was doing everything myself. The goal was to bootstrap this project into profitability without taking outside money.  
在这段时间里，我没有其他工作或收入，过的比较节俭。我没有太多的广告或营销预算，所以一切都是我自己在做。目标是在不需要外部资金的情况下将该项目引入盈利。

###What went into building the initial product?  
###是如何建立最初的产品的？  

The whole development process from concept to launch was about three months. During that time, I had weekly meetings with different gym managers to go over the software they were currently using and discuss their pain points. I would then go back and start brainstorming how to address these pain points, and build my ideas into the prototype. When it launched in February 2016, it had all the basic features I had in mind from discussions with gym managers, though the product I have today has evolved significantly.  
从概念到发布的整个开发过程大概是三个月。 在那段时间里，我每周都会与不同的健身房经理会面，讨论他们当前使用的软件和痛点。然后，我会回头开始头脑风暴来寻找如何解决这些痛点，并将我的想法融入设计原型。当它在2016年2月推出时，它具有我与健身房经理讨论过的所有基本特征，尽管我今天的产品已经有了显着的提升。

Despite the name, MAonRails is actually built on a LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP), and not Ruby on Rails. The backend is built on a heavily extended Zend Framework installation that I built over many years through doing other projects. The front end uses basic web technologies with a heavy dose of jQuery. All the flows are fully optimized for mobile and tablets.  
尽管有这个名字，但MAonRails实际上是建立在LEMP堆栈上的（Linux，Nginx，MySQL，PHP），而不是Ruby on Rails。后端是建立在我多年来通过其他项目构建的大量扩展的Zend Framework安装上的。前端使用基本的Web技术和大量的jQuery 并且所有流程都针对手机和平板电脑进行了全面优化。


###How have you attracted users and grown Martial Arts on Rails?  
###你如何吸引和增长用户的呢？
Since I didn't have a major budget for marketing, my focus was initially on the organic and social channels. I tried generating some press for the launch but it was difficult. I did get it featured on Product Hunt, though it wasn't exactly the target audience.  
由于我没有重大的市场营销预算，所以我的重点首先放在有机和社交渠道上。在产品发布的时候，我尝试过一些新闻和消息的渠道，但是那真的很难。我在Product Hunt上发布了它的消息，尽管PH上不完全是目标受众。

I created content targeted for gym managers on the company blog, focusing on the digital aspects of running a gym — how to run marketing, do local SEO for gyms, generate funnels to attract gym members, running referral programs and so forth. I contacted many online publications in the fitness and martial arts verticals, and did some guest blogging to generate traffic and links back to my site.    
我在公司博客上创建了针对健身房经理的内容，重点关注运营健身房的一些电子化的角度，如 如何运营营销，为健身房做本地搜索引擎优化，创建漏斗以吸引健身房成员，运行推介计划等等。我联系了健身和武术垂直领域的许多在线媒体，写了一些约稿以产生流量并链接到我的网站。


At the same time, I ran a very active Twitter account that was sharing general fitness and martial-arts related content. To gain awareness of the account, I used a Twitter automation tool that is no longer available due to changes to the Twitter API. I was also very active on several subreddits where many gym owners and managers participate (specifically /r/bjj), and did a soft sell here and there without being too aggressive. I had been a longtime part of the community so I knew the right way to approach it without upsetting people. Now whenever someone posts there about gym management software, people usually refer them my way.  
与此同时，我运行了一个非常活跃的Twitter帐户，分享了一般健身和武术相关的内容。为了获得更多人的关注，我当时还使用了一个Twitter自动助手，但由于Twitter API的更改，现在已经用不了了。我在reddit上的一些看板(subreddits)上也很活跃，因为那里有很多健身房的经营者和经理，同时在那里进行了一次并不激进的软销售。

[![xSwxp.jpg](https://s1.ax2x.com/2018/05/19/xSwxp.jpg)](https://simimg.com/i/xSwxp)

I contacted all the gym owners I'd been working with to develop the initial software and got them to try it out as an actual replacement to what they had. Those were my first real customers. It's a very tight community, so over time they referred others my way. Surprisingly, merchant account sellers have also been a source of referrals. After connecting with one through one of my customers, we started a cross-referral collaboration, and they referred quite a few new customers my way over time.  
我联系了我一直在与之合作的所有健身房老板，以开发最初的软件，并让他们尝试将其作为他们所拥有的实际替代品。那些是我第一批真正的客户。 这是一个非常紧凑的社区，所以随着时间的推移，他们会推荐给其他人。令人惊讶的是，商家账户卖家也是推荐人的来源。在与我的一位客户联系之后，我们开始了一项交叉推荐协作，随着时间的推移，他们引荐了不少新客户。

I tried AdWords for a little while with a small budget, but couldn't get good results there since it requires deep knowledge of competitive keywords. After a couple of months I started running ads on Capterra, a search engine for business software, where I am now ranked first in searches for "martial arts gym software". This has become my strongest source for conversions. I was initially spending around $180 a month on Capterra, and it's now closer to $400 a month. Currently, Capterra and organic search results are the main acquisitions sources for my business.    
我花了一点时间尝试了谷歌广告(AdWords)，但预算不多，由于需要对竞争性关键字有深入的了解，因此尝试的效果并不是很好。几个月后，我开始在商业软件搜索引擎Capterra上投放广告，现在我在搜索“武术健身房软件”时排名第一。这已经成为我转换的最主要的流量来源。 最初我每月在Capterra上花费180美元左右，现在每个月的费用已经接近400美元。目前，Capterra和自然搜索结果是我业务的主要收购来源。

###What's your business model, and how have you grown your revenue?  
###你的商业模式是什么，以及你如何提升收入呢？
The service is a freemium subscription based SaaS. Paying users are either charged on a monthly basis at one of five different pricing plans, or on custom plans. I provide a 30-day free trial with all the features included, after which it is downgraded to a limited free version if the account is not upgraded.  
我的服务是基于免费与增值服务的SaaS。付费用户可以按五种不同的定价计划之一付费，或定制自己的方案。我提供30天免费试用版，其中包含所有功能，如果帐户未升级，则会降级为有限功能的免费版本。


One of the main things that helped with growth was setting up an online chat on the site (I use Olark). By talking to potential customers on a daily basis, I was able to learn a lot about what is needed to get them on board. I also set up an email drip campaign for new sign-ups that starts with a personal welcome email, and then sends several follow ups that try to engage users to avoid churn. One of the emails is sent 10 days before the trial period is over, and asks the user if they would like an extension of the trial — many users respond to this one, and it has helped keep more users than any other feature.    
促进增长的主要因素之一是在网站上建立在线沟通（我使用Olark）。通过每天与潜在客户交流，我能够知道如何让他们参与进来。我还为新注册用户开设了电子邮件活动，以个人欢迎电子邮件开始，然后发送多个后续活动，尝试吸引用户以避免流失。其中一封电子邮件会在试用期结束前10天发送，并询问用户是否希望扩展试用版，许多用户对此作出了回应，这个帮助我保留了很多用户。


##"Always be talking to your customers — that's the only way to really understand how people interact with your product."
##"始终与客户交谈，这是真正理解人们如何与您的产品互动的唯一途径。"


In the beginning, the conversion rate of sign ups to paying customers was around 5%. Four months after launch, I got my first two paying customers. They were a couple of the gym managers I knew personally, but it still took me several months to get them to switch to the paid plan. Now conversion is a bit over 8%, an improvement I attribute mostly to feature additions that address some common use-cases, and the email drip cycle mentioned above.  
一开始，付费客户的注册转化率约为5％。 推出四个月后，我才找到了前两位付费用户， 他们是我认识的几位健身房经理，但我花了几个月的时间才让他们转向付费计划。现在转换率有点超过8％，这主要是因为功能增加了一些典型案例，以及上面提到的电子邮件营销。

As a career software developer, I never did much in the way of customer service because generally I had co-founders or employees to handle most of the customer interactions. As a solo operation, however, it quickly became apparent that getting good at providing customer service was paramount. Talking to customers really exposed me to all the weak parts of the application — problems with the user experience, missing documentation, confusing features, and more. This focus on customer service has helped me establish personal relationships with many of my paid customers. Over time, many of them have referred additional paying users, not just based on the quality of the product, but because of how happy they were with the customer service I was providing.  
作为一名职业软件开发人员，我从未在客户服务方面做过这么多工作，因为通常我有共同创始人或员工来处理。然而，作为一个独立开发者，我很快意识到了善于提供客户服务是最重要的。与客户交谈确实使我知道了应用程序的所有薄弱环节，如：用户体验问题，文档丢失，功能混淆等等。对于客服工作的专注，帮助我与很多我的付费用户建立了很好的个人联系。逐渐他们中的很多人都推荐了一些额外的付费用户，不仅仅是基于产品的质量，而是因为他们对我提供的客户服务感到满意。

The main takeaway is to always be talking to your customers — that's the only way to really understand how people interact with your product.  
主要的任务是始终与客户交谈 - 这是真正理解人们如何与您的产品互动的唯一途径。

###What are your goals for the future?  
###未来的目标是什么？
2017 was mostly about listening to customer feedback and improving the product incrementally. I now feel that the product is in a good place to start increasing marketing efforts and spending, though I'm currently on pace to double revenue without any additional marketing. My overarching goal for 2018 is to quadruple revenue.  
2017年主要是倾听客户反馈并逐步改进产品。我现在认为，尽管我并没有增加任何的市场营销费用，目前的产品正在一个好的节点去开始增加市场营销的预算和努力，目标是使得营收翻倍。2018年我的首要目标是实现收入翻两番。



As revenue is ramping up, I'm looking to invest more of it back into growth. Some of my goals for 2018 include:  

随着收入的增加，我正在寻求将更多的资金投入到增长中。 2018年我的一些目标包括：

· Setting up an ROI positive AdWords campaign and slowly ramp up spend
· Hiring an outbound sales person
· Establishing more cross-referral collaborations with merchant account resellers
· Starting an affiliate program to incentivize users to refer us
  
· 建立一个正向的AdWords投资回报，并逐步扩大推广
· 雇佣一个对外销售人员
· 与经销商建立更多的交叉推荐协作
· 启动联盟返佣计划以激励用户引荐我们

[![xfqwA.jpg](https://s1.ax2x.com/2018/05/19/xfqwA.jpg)](https://simimg.com/i/xfqwA)

The biggest challenge will be getting the outbound sales effort started. The main problem with hiring salespeople is that they're usually good at selling themselves at interviews and it would likely take a few attempts until I find the right person.  
最大的挑战将是开展对外销售工作。招聘销售人员的主要问题是，他们通常善于在面试时自我销售，但可能需要尝试几次，直到找到合适的人。


### What are the biggest challenges you've faced and obstacles you've overcome? If you had to start over, what would you do differently?  
###你面临的最大挑战是什么以及你已经克服了哪些障碍？ 如果你必须重新开始，你会有什么不同？  

Getting the word out there was difficult initially. I had to do a lot of leg work just to get a few articles published, and for a few months I was getting zero traction, which was a bit discouraging. If I had wanted to grow more aggressively, getting an outbound sales operation going early would have probably been a good idea.  
最初的时候，宣传工作真的很难。为了发出几篇文章，我不得不做很多工作（包括跑腿），几个月后，我的努力没有任何回报，这有点令人沮丧。如果我想要更积极地成长，那么也许我会更早开展对外销售。

Other than that, the process went about as I expected from having previously started multiple similar companies.
  
除此之外，这个过程与我之前开始创建多家类似公司的预期一样。

###Have you found anything particularly helpful or advantageous?  
###你有没有找到特别有用或有利的东西？  

Starting a business in an industry I've been involved in as a consumer for many years has really helped me understand the market and build the product accordingly. I also had existing connections I could use to get feedback and gain early customers.
  
在一个我曾经作为一个消费者参与多年的行业创业，真的帮助我了解市场并相应地构建产品。我也有现有的关系网可以用来获得反馈并获得早期客户。

I see a lot of entrepreneurs try to tackle lucrative markets that they don't know much about because they see an opportunity. While that can work, I'd recommend you start a business in a market you're deeply familiar with to increase your chances of success.  
我看到很多创业者试图处理他们不太了解但利润丰厚的市场，因为他们看到了机会。虽然这也可行，但我建议你在一个你非常熟悉的市场开始创业，以增加你获得成功的机会。

###"Getting good at providing customer service was paramount."
###"最重要的是善于提供客户服务。"


On the more operational side, a few things I'd recommend:  
在执行层面，我有一些建议：

· Set up a live chat — either Olark or Intercom
· Setting up an Email drip campaign. I built my own system using Mailgun's API, but Mailchimp and others have pre-built systems you can use. Also, check out Patrick McKenzie's course on drip campaigns
· If you have a B2B product, consider Capterra for running ads
· Engage your customers on a daily basis. Talk to them, understand how they're using your product and what their pain points are. Talk to people who churn out or pick a competitor — understand what's missing for them.


· 设立在线沟通系统，无论是 Olark 或是 Intercom
· 设置电子邮件营销。 我使用Mailgun的API构建了自己的系统，但Mailchimp和其他系统已经预先构建了可以直接使用的系统。 另外，可以看看Patrick McKenzie关于电子邮件营销的课程
· 如果您做的是B2B产品，可以优先考虑Capterra的广告
· 参与与客户的沟通。 与他们交谈，了解他们如何使用您的产品以及他们的痛点是什么。 与流失的用户沟通，以了解他们缺少的东西。


###What's your advice for indie hackers who are just starting out? 
###你对indie hacker 刚刚创业的读者有什么建议？

If you don't have all the skills needed to build, launch, and market a product by yourself, strongly consider finding a co-founder to do it with you. It's hard to get everything right the first time, and sharing responsibilities can be a big help.    
如果您不具备一个人构建、发布和推销产品所需的所有技能，请强烈考虑找到联合创始人与您一起完成此任务。一次做到完美很难，大家分担与分工会很有用。


I'll repeat this one more time: talk to your customers. Many technical founders that I meet base all of their decisions on analytics and technical metrics. There's value in that as well (I track a bunch of parameters), but true understanding only comes from actually talking to your target audience. Engage them in chat, send them emails, get them on the phone, meet them in person — do everything you can to understand them better.  
我会再次重复这一点：与您的客户交谈。 我遇到的许多技术创始人都基于分析和技术指标进行决策。虽然这也是有价值的（我跟踪了一堆参数），但真正的理解只来自实际与目标受众沟通。与他们聊天，给他们发电子邮件，电话沟通或亲自见面，尽你所能地更好地了解他们。
